# Image-Classification-CNN

This project implements image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch.

# Dataset
- Source: CIFAR-10 dataset
- Description: The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy


# Project Structure
- Download and Extract Dataset: The CIFAR-10 dataset is downloaded and extracted.
- Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and transformed into tensors.
- Model Definition: A CNN model is defined using PyTorch.
- Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set.
- Visualization: Training and validation metrics are visualized.
- Prediction: The model's predictions on test images are demonstrated.


# Results
- The model achieves reasonable accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Training and validation losses and accuracies are plotted for each epoch.
- Predictions for sample test images are shown.
